# Origin Story
This personal project intends to put newly acquire knowledge (thanks to COVID furlough), of C++17 and 
the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/), to use.  It's a work-in-progress.  I am super open to 
any feedback, especially in regards to C++.

# TODO
- [ ] API-ise the C++ GoL code
  - [ ] Make the grid size 'user-defined'
  - [ ] Unit test + code coverage
- [ ] Create the Godot infrastructure
  - [ ] Incorporate C++ GoL into Godot
